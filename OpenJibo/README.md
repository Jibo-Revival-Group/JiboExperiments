# OpenJibo

OpenJibo is the working revival track for Jibo.

We are rebuilding the hosted cloud first, then using that foundation for OTA, Open Jibo OS, and a tiered brain that can eventually hand higher-order work to CoffeeBreak without losing Jibo's original charm.

## Current Focus

- ship a stable Azure-hosted replacement cloud
- keep the Node prototype as the protocol oracle and capture harness
- port the production path to .NET
- support real devices through repeatable bootstrap steps first
- use OTA later to reduce recovery friction once the cloud is trustworthy

Current release truth lives in [docs/development-plan.md](docs/development-plan.md). The current cloud release constant is `1.0.20`.

## Running Locally

For local setup, use [docs/local-cloud-quickstart.md](docs/local-cloud-quickstart.md).

For device bootstrap and OOBE QR setup, use:

- [docs/device-bootstrap.md](docs/device-bootstrap.md)
- [docs/wifi-qr-oobe.md](docs/wifi-qr-oobe.md)

It covers:

- the current `.NET` OpenJibo cloud
- the legacy Node protocol oracle
- the Playground direct-to-Jibo ASR/TTS demo

## Roadmap

The long-range plan is summarized in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). In short:

1. Working hosted cloud.
2. OTA-assisted recovery and updates.
3. Open Jibo OS / `open-jibo` mode conversion.
4. Tiered brain and CoffeeBreak orchestration.
5. Broader ecosystem expansion.

## Current Architecture

The repo now has three distinct lanes:

- `src/Jibo.Cloud/node`
  Protocol oracle, discovery server, fixture source, and rapid reverse-engineering lab.
- `src/Jibo.Cloud/dotnet`
  Production-oriented hosted implementation intended for Azure deployment and long-term maintenance.
- `src/Jibo.Runtime.Abstractions`
  The seam between robot/cloud traffic and higher-level runtime and capability logic.

The core shape is:

```text
Jibo device -> OpenJibo cloud -> normalized runtime contracts -> capabilities and planning
```

## First Supported Device Path

The first supported recovery path is enthusiast-friendly, not zero-touch:

```text
QR Wi-Fi -> inject OpenJibo region config -> set robot region ->
RCM/device patch for TLS and host acceptance -> OpenJibo cloud on Azure
```

That path is documented in [docs/device-bootstrap.md](docs/device-bootstrap.md).

## Design Principles

- Preserve the original skills and visual design.
- Build the hosted cloud before making OTA the default recovery path.
- Keep every migration reversible whenever possible.
- Prefer source-backed slices over speculative rewrites.
- Let Jibo remain the face of the experience, even when higher-level orchestration sits behind him.
